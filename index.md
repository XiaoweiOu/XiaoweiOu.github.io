# About me
I am a undergraduate student in University of Science and Technology of China, majoring in Physics. I will graduate in June 2021 and now I am seeking for a master/PhD position. What I did in the past mainly focuses on experimental particle physics, especially collider physics such as D0@Tevatran and ATLAS@Cern. But I am also intersted in studying other fields of physics (theoritical or computational are better) and software/hardware in graduate school. More infomation about my research experience is availabe below.
